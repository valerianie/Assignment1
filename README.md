# MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis
##### Assignment 1
##### Jasmin Cantzler, Wiebke Weiger & Valeria Nieberg
##### 2 October 2015

*The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics. Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. The repository should be fully documented, including with a descriptive README.md file. The repository will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. Deadline 2 October, 10% of final grade.*

Please run the file **Assignment1_Master** as it contains the dynamic links to two datasets.
If you have an interest in fertilizer rates consult the **Assignment1_file2.R R script** for a third data set. 

Description of chosen data sets:
- **women** contains average heights and weights for American Women
- **InsectSprays** contains the counts of insects in agricultural experimental units treated with different insecticides.
- **main_data** contains data on fertilizer consumptions in various countries from 2005-2011

We made two  pull requests:
- The first one to https://github.com/gtarriba/GabrielRepo. We added message=FALSE in  swisspres.Rmd to suppress message in output. 
- The second one to https://github.com/ChristopherCosler/CollaborativeDataAnalysisChristopherAndLisa to suggest to add a citation of the R software.
